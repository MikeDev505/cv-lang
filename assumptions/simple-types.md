# Simple types

## With fixed size
Signed
* int8 - signde 8bit
* int16 or short- signed 16bit
* int32 or int- signed 32 -int is alias of int32 and always is 32bit
* int64 or long- signed 64
* int128 - signed 128
* float - 32-bit floating
* double - 64-bit floating

Unsigned
* byte - 8bit unsigned
* uint16 or ushort - unsigned 16bit
* uint32 or uint- unsigned 32 -int is alias of int32 and always is 32bit
* uint64 or long- unsigned 64
* uint128 - unsigned 128


## size depend on context

Text
* string - size depend on contex - it contains lenght and capacity on first bytes (2,4 or 8 bytes)
* char - size depend on context - reprezent utf-8 or utf-32 char


# Array
